--- Configuration for overlook.nvim
---
--- Configuration module for overlook.nvim, providing default settings and user
--- customization capabilities for popup behavior, styling, and adapter configurations.
---
--- This module handles the setup and merging of user-provided options with
--- sensible defaults, ensuring the plugin works out of the box while allowing
--- extensive customization.
---
--- # Features ~
---
--- - Type-safe configuration with comprehensive field definitions
--- - Deep merging of user options with sensible defaults
--- - Flexible UI customization (borders, positioning, sizing)
--- - Adapter-specific configuration support
--- - Runtime configuration access for other modules
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module is typically used indirectly through the main overlook setup:
--- >lua
---   require('overlook').setup({
---     ui = {
---       border = "single",
---       row_offset = 2,
---       size_ratio = 0.8
---     }
---   })
--- <
---
--- Direct access to configuration:
--- >lua
---   local opts = require('overlook.config').get()
--- <
---@tag overlook-config

local M = {}
